Master Thesis Mutation Intelligent Game

This program is a basis part of my Master Thesis "Selection of Software Tests and
Mutants with Contextual Bandits" for the UiO University. It uses contextual bandits to learn selection of good tests and mutants. In addition it produces helpful data for analysis.

The program is structured on 3 main folders: code, generation and major.

- major is for the Major mutation testing framework
- code includes all the written program files and the output, as well as the scripts to run the experiments
- generation is where mutants, tests, coverage files and all related files are generated, together with the source files and libraries. It also contains scripts for automatic compilation, java version fix, and generation.
